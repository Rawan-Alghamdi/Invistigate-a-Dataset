# Invistigate-a-Dataset
This is the third project for Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Udacity

In this project, I analyze a dataset (Movies Dataset - 10,000 movies collected from the movie database TMDband)then communicated my findings about it.
I used Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis process easier.
